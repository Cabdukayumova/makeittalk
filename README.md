This tutorial is dedicated to create an animation based on input image and voice.

> Important: For this you should have Nvidia GPU. If you don't have it please check [this](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yzhou359/MakeItTalk/blob/main/quick_demo.ipynb) Google Colab link for quick testing.

Two important moments:
